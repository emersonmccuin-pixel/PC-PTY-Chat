// AgentRunRegistry — global concurrency cap + FIFO over-cap queue.
//
// Design §4.1: dispatched AgentRuns share a single global cap (default 5,
// clamped 1..50; validated by labs scenario 03 — N=5 reliable, N=8 introduces
// handshake-timeout rate). InteractiveSessions are uncapped and bypass this
// registry entirely.
//
// Contract: callers obtain a Ticket via admit(). The ticket's `granted`
// promise resolves when a slot is available. Calling release() returns the
// slot. Calling abort() removes a still-queued ticket from the FIFO without
// consuming a slot; on an admitted ticket it's equivalent to release().
//
// One Registry instance per Node process is the production shape; tests
// construct fresh instances with whatever cap they need.
