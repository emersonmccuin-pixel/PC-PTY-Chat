# Refactor Plan Tracker

This tracker coordinates subsystem architecture handoff documents.

Subsystem documents belong in `refactor plan/refactor plan docs/`.

Use `refactor plan/subsystem-architecture-handoff-prompt.md` to create each subsystem document.

Use `refactor plan/target-architecture.md` as the north-star architecture for every subsystem document.

The target architecture is desired direction, not current implementation truth.

## Status Values

- `not started`: subsystem is identified but not documented.
- `in progress`: analysis is underway.
- `documented`: subsystem handoff doc exists.
- `needs synthesis`: doc has cross-subsystem conflicts or decisions to reconcile.
- `synthesized`: included in the holistic architecture synthesis.
- `planned`: implementation plan exists.
- `implemented`: implementation completed and verified.

## Current Refactor Priority

These are the subsystems of concern because they do not always work as expected.

Each priority subsystem document must include a `Target Architecture Alignment` section that compares the subsystem to `refactor plan/target-architecture.md`.

| Order | Focus | Tracker Subsystem | Target Doc | Why Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | UI refresh / WebSocket system | WebSocket/event propagation | `refactor plan/refactor plan docs/ui-refresh-websocket-event-propagation.md` | Stale or missing UI updates make every other subsystem appear unreliable. | Establish event contracts, invalidation rules, frontend subscriptions, and ownership of projected state. |
| 2 | Chat | Chat runtime and transcript UI | `refactor plan/refactor plan docs/chat-runtime-and-transcript-ui.md` | Chat is the main runtime surface and currently mixes transcript, runtime state, tool events, pending prompts, and UI projection. | Decide whether chat is source of truth or a view over durable runtime/session events. |
| 3 | Agents | Agent runs | `refactor plan/refactor plan docs/agents-and-agent-runs.md` | Agent lifecycle, dispatch, recovery, transcript persistence, and control behavior are core app reliability concerns. | Include agent host, pods/orchestrator, verification, pause/resume, and active-run state as related areas. |
| 4 | Workflows | Workflows and workflow builder | `refactor plan/refactor plan docs/workflows-and-workflow-builder.md` | Workflows connect UI-authored plans, DAG execution, agents, work items, and durable run state. | Clarify whether workflows are orchestration records, templates, or both. |
| 5 | MCP and tooling | MCP bridge and MCP tools | `refactor plan/refactor plan docs/mcp-and-tooling.md` | Tool availability and MCP integration affect what agents can actually do. | Define canonical tool registry, tool availability, and app-owned vs external tools. |
| 6 | Channel server replacement | Channel server | `refactor plan/refactor plan docs/channel-server-agent-messaging-inbox.md` | Current channel behavior should be reconsidered as an app-owned agent/orchestrator messaging inbox. | Treat as replacement design: durable messages, delivery state, ack/read state, retries, ordering, and recovery. |
| 7 | Whole system at large | Holistic synthesis | `refactor plan/holistic-architecture-synthesis.md` | Reconcile the subsystem recommendations into one coherent architecture. | Run after the six priority subsystem docs exist. |

Lower priority for now:

- Desktop shell.
- Web app shell.
- Other supporting subsystems unless they become blockers during priority analysis.

## Planning-to-Build Workflow

The six priority subsystem handoffs and the holistic synthesis are complete. The next phase is to turn those findings into buildable, testable slices without losing cross-system coherence.

### Refactor Target Decision

The real implementation target is the current repo, not a blank rewrite in a new directory.

- Build new clean boundaries inside this repo.
- Use scratch directories only for disposable spikes or experiments.
- Preserve existing data/runtime/MCP/UI compatibility until replacement paths are tested.
- Do not start a parallel replacement app unless the user explicitly changes this decision.

### New Session Startup

Every new planning, implementation-planning, or build-slice session should start here:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `refactor plan/refactor-session-tracker.md` to identify the manual session row.
3. Read `refactor plan/target-architecture.md`.
4. Read `refactor plan/holistic-architecture-synthesis.md`.
5. Read this tracker.
6. If a planning artifact is marked `in progress` or `not started`, read that artifact; otherwise read the artifact named by the next unchecked session row.
7. For manual Session 9, read `refactor plan/build-slices/001-foundation-vertical-slice.md` and treat it as the first build-slice implementation, not roadmap Phase 9.
8. Inspect current code only for the scope being planned or implemented.
9. Update this tracker and `refactor plan/refactor-session-tracker.md` before ending the session.

Current next action:

- Manual Session 9 is ready when the user explicitly asks to build.
- Session 9 must start by restoring the minimal test harness and P0 tests listed in `refactor plan/build-slices/001-foundation-vertical-slice.md`.
- Session 9 must implement only slice 001: project list/project metadata contracts, route/service parity, non-durable `project.changed` refetch, web typing/refetch integration, and focused tests.
- Do not treat manual Session 9 as roadmap Phase 9. Roadmap Phase 9 is the later Channel delivery cutover and is not the next build target.

### Process Flow

| Step | Output | Purpose | Gate before moving on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `refactor plan/implementation-roadmap.md` | Convert synthesis into phases, PR boundaries, dependencies, rollback notes, and acceptance criteria. | Roadmap names build phases and first vertical slice without changing implementation code. |
| 2 | Foundation specs | Resolve the blocking architecture decisions that every build slice depends on. | Each spec defines schemas, ownership, migration phases, compatibility, and tests. |
| 3 | Work-item dependency handoff | Document work items/stages/fields/attachments because agents and workflows depend on them. | Agent/workflow plans can reference work-item contracts without guessing. |
| 4 | Phase 0 test characterization plan | Define the tests to restore or recreate before behavior refactors. | Test plan covers current WS, chat replay/send queue, agent asks, workflow review/cancel, MCP tools, and Channel delivery. |
| 5 | First build-slice plan | Pick a small vertical slice, likely shared contracts plus one low-risk feature. | Slice has scope, files, tests, rollback, compatibility, and stop conditions. |
| 6 | Build only when explicitly requested | Implementation follows the slice plan. | User explicitly asks to build; planning docs and tests/verification are sufficient for the slice. |

### Foundation Spec Queue

These specs should be concise and practical, not new long-form audits. Each should include decisions, proposed contract shapes, ownership, migration phases, acceptance criteria, tests, and open questions.

| Order | Artifact | Status | Output Path | Depends On | Exit Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Implementation roadmap | planned | `refactor plan/implementation-roadmap.md` | Holistic synthesis | Ordered build phases, PR/checkpoint boundaries, first vertical slice, rollback strategy, and test gates are documented. |
| 2 | Shared contracts and app services spec | planned | `refactor plan/foundation specs/shared-contracts-and-app-services.md` | Implementation roadmap | Contract package rules, app-service boundaries, validation approach, MCP access rule, and first migrated feature are defined. |
| 3 | Live events and outbox spec | planned | `refactor plan/foundation specs/live-events-and-outbox.md` | Shared contracts direction | Canonical envelope, scope/global semantics, cursor/replay, outbox table, legacy adapter, and tests are defined. |
| 4 | Mailbox and pending interactions spec | planned | `refactor plan/foundation specs/mailbox-and-pending-interactions.md` | Shared contracts direction, Channel synthesis | Recipient identity, message/delivery/ack model, pending-interaction ownership, UI inbox, orchestrator-turn policy, and migration path are defined. |
| 5 | Runtime transcript and conversation store spec | planned | `refactor plan/foundation specs/runtime-transcript-and-conversation-store.md` | Shared contracts direction, chat handoff | Transcript repository strategy, file compatibility, SQLite mirror decision, replay cursor, send queue service boundary, and tests are defined. |
| 6 | Work items/stages/fields/attachments handoff | planned | `refactor plan/refactor plan docs/work-items-stages-fields-attachments.md` | Existing subsystem docs | Work-item contracts and stage/field/attachment dependencies for agents/workflows/MCP/live events are documented. |
| 7 | Phase 0 test characterization plan | planned | `refactor plan/phase-0-test-characterization-plan.md` | Foundation specs | Restore/recreate test inventory, current behavior characterization, known-bug tests, and CI/local commands are documented. |
| 8 | First build-slice plan | planned | `refactor plan/build-slices/001-foundation-vertical-slice.md` | Roadmap and Phase 0 plan | Created; picks project list/project metadata as the smallest contract-first vertical slice, with shared contracts, a narrow project service seam, route parity, a non-durable `project.changed` refetch event, web refetch handling, rollback notes, and slice-specific tests. |

### Build-Readiness Gates

Do not start implementation refactors until the relevant slice has:

- an owning roadmap phase;
- explicit contracts or compatibility contract;
- current-state evidence from code;
- migration and rollback steps;
- test plan, including characterization tests where behavior is risky;
- a tracker update marking the artifact or subsystem `planned`;
- user confirmation that implementation should begin.

### Slice Shape

Every planned build slice should follow the same cartridge shape:

```text
contract
  -> app service / repo boundary
  -> route adapter
  -> live event or mailbox fact
  -> web client/hook
  -> MCP adapter when relevant
  -> tests
```

## Change Log

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-05-30 | Incorporated `target-architecture.md` as the north-star architecture for subsystem analysis and holistic synthesis. |
| 2026-05-30 | Marked priority refactor sequence: UI refresh/WebSocket, chat, agents, workflows, MCP/tooling, channel-server replacement, then whole-system synthesis. |
| 2026-05-30 | Created tracker and subsystem handoff prompt. |
| 2026-05-30 | Documented chat runtime and transcript UI subsystem; marked it `needs synthesis` because transcript storage, live envelope replay, pending asks, and agent transcript convergence cross subsystem boundaries. |
| 2026-05-30 | Added agent runs subsystem handoff at `refactor plan/refactor plan docs/agents-and-agent-runs.md`; marked tracker row `needs synthesis` because it conflicts with WebSocket/live-event, mailbox, chat transcript, workflow, and MCP contract decisions. |
| 2026-05-30 | Documented WebSocket/event propagation handoff and marked it `needs synthesis`; added live event contracts/outbox as a discovered subsystem candidate. |
| 2026-05-30 | Documented MCP/tooling handoff and marked it `needs synthesis` because tool contracts, capability registry ownership, runtime MCP readiness, external MCP server validation, workflows, agents, live events, and mailbox ownership need cross-subsystem reconciliation. |
| 2026-05-30 | Documented Channel server replacement / agent messaging inbox handoff and marked it `needs synthesis`; added human review inbox and approval surfaces as a discovered subsystem candidate. |
| 2026-05-30 | Documented workflows and workflow builder handoff and marked it `needs synthesis` because workflow identity, live events, active-run recovery/cancellation, review inbox, agents, MCP, and transient builder state cross subsystem boundaries. |
| 2026-05-30 | Updated Channel replacement target to no-channel architecture: durable mailbox plus UI inbox and app-injected orchestrator turns; Channel/dev-channel bridge is a delete target, not a compatibility adapter. |
| 2026-05-30 | Created holistic architecture synthesis at `refactor plan/holistic-architecture-synthesis.md`; marked six priority subsystem docs as `synthesized`; added follow-up candidates for shared contracts/app-services, transcript store, mailbox workers, capability registry, and pending interactions/approvals. |

| 2026-05-30 | Updated `AGENTS.md` for the post-synthesis planning-to-build workflow and added README guidance for `foundation specs/`, `build-slices/`, and subsystem docs. |
| 2026-05-30 | Recorded refactor target decision: build the new architecture inside the current repo; use separate scratch directories only for disposable spikes, not the real implementation. |
| 2026-05-30 | Added manual session tracker at `refactor plan/refactor-session-tracker.md` and linked it from `AGENTS.md` and the tracker startup workflow. |
| 2026-05-30 | Created implementation roadmap at `refactor plan/implementation-roadmap.md`; marked roadmap artifact `planned`; named first foundation vertical slice and confirmed shared contracts/app services spec as the next planning artifact. |
| 2026-05-30 | Created shared contracts and app services foundation spec at `refactor plan/foundation specs/shared-contracts-and-app-services.md`; marked the artifact and subsystem `planned`; selected project list/project metadata as the first contract family and typed localhost HTTP as the first MCP adapter path. |
| 2026-05-30 | Created live events and outbox foundation spec at `refactor plan/foundation specs/live-events-and-outbox.md`; marked the artifact and subsystem `planned`; defined canonical `LiveEvent` scope/cursor semantics, proposed `live_outbox`, preserved legacy WS adapters during migration, and selected `project.changed` as the first event family. |
| 2026-05-30 | Created mailbox and pending interactions foundation spec at `refactor plan/foundation specs/mailbox-and-pending-interactions.md`; marked the artifact plus mailbox and pending-interaction subsystem rows `planned`; defined typed recipient addresses, mailbox delivery state, pending-interaction action ownership, UI inbox/orchestrator-turn policy, and send-queue acceptance as the first runtime-turn acknowledgement. |
| 2026-05-30 | Created runtime transcript and conversation store foundation spec at `refactor plan/foundation specs/runtime-transcript-and-conversation-store.md`; marked the artifact and conversation/runtime transcript store subsystem `planned`; defined file-backed transcript repository first, SQLite mirror-only storage until parity tests pass, transcript `seq` replay cursor versus live outbox cursor, send queue service boundary, `/api/ask` compatibility, and mailbox-facing `enqueueRuntimeTurn`. |
| 2026-05-30 | Created work items/stages/fields/attachments handoff at `refactor plan/refactor plan docs/work-items-stages-fields-attachments.md`; marked the artifact plus work-item and attachment subsystem rows `planned`; documented agent/workflow/MCP/live-event dependencies, event gaps, stage/field risks, attachment policy gaps, and characterization-test needs. |
| 2026-05-30 | Created Phase 0 test characterization plan at `refactor plan/phase-0-test-characterization-plan.md`; marked the artifact `planned`; documented the missing active test harness, 155 deleted tracked tests as restore candidates, P0/P1/P2 characterization coverage by subsystem, known-gap policy, local/CI commands, and slice-specific test gates. |
| 2026-05-30 | Created first foundation build-slice plan at `refactor plan/build-slices/001-foundation-vertical-slice.md`; marked the artifact `planned`; selected project list/project metadata as the smallest contract-first slice and limited implementation scope to shared contracts, a narrow project service seam, route parity, a non-durable `project.changed` refetch event, web contract/refetch integration, and focused tests. |
| 2026-05-30 | Prepared manual Session 9 by syncing `refactor-session-tracker.md` through Session 8, clarifying that Session 9 is the first build slice rather than roadmap Phase 9, updating startup workflow when no planning artifact is in progress, and standardizing the first project live/refetch event name to `project.changed`. |
