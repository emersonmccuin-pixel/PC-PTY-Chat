# Definitive Refactor Session Pathway

This is the required path from the completed first foundation slice into the rest of the refactor. It exists to remove guessing between sessions.

## Control Rules

- Start every session with `git status --short`.
- Work only from a clean repo.
- End every session by updating the tracker files, committing completed work, and confirming `git status --short` is clean.
- Do not restart, kill, or replace running dev processes from an agent session.
- Do not begin a build session unless the matching build-slice plan exists and is marked ready.
- Do not advance to the next slice when verification fails.
- If verification fails, the next session is a fix-and-reverify session for the same slice.
- Keep each implementation slice inside its named scope. Do not add adjacent subsystem work because it is convenient.
- Each slice has three session types: plan, build, verify.
- Planning sessions may update docs only.
- Build sessions may update implementation code only inside the owning slice.
- Verify sessions may fix only defects discovered in that slice verification. Broader work becomes a new planned slice.

## Required Slice Order

| Slice | Owning roadmap phase | Required output | Build scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | Phase 1 and Phase 2 | `refactor plan/build-slices/001-foundation-vertical-slice.md` | Project contracts, project app-service seam, route parity, compatibility `project.changed`, web refetch integration, focused tests. |
| 002 | Phase 3 | `refactor plan/build-slices/002-project-live-outbox.md` | Durable `live_outbox` for `project.changed` only, canonical live-event contract, replay route, compatibility fanout, web cursor/refetch path, tests. |
| 003 | Phase 4 | `refactor plan/build-slices/003-work-items-stages-fields-events.md` | Work-item/stage/field/attachment shared contracts, app-service mutation gateway, route/MCP/web compatibility, `work-item.changed` and `stage.list.changed`, tests. |
| 004 | Phase 5 | `refactor plan/build-slices/004-workflow-definition-run-service.md` | Workflow definition/run/review service boundary, stable run identity/version, cancellation and boot reconciliation, compatibility routes, tests. |
| 005 | Phase 6 | `refactor plan/build-slices/005-agent-run-service.md` | Agent-run command service, pending-ask atomicity, status/rev live events, pause/resume/cancel compatibility, tests. |
| 006 | Phase 7 | `refactor plan/build-slices/006-conversation-send-replay-service.md` | Conversation/session/send/replay service seam, transcript repository over existing files, send queue facade, pending-interaction shadowing, tests. |
| 007 | Phase 8 | `refactor plan/build-slices/007-mailbox-platform.md` | Mailbox contracts, tables, repos, delivery leases, UI inbox, orchestrator-turn worker over send service, tests. |
| 008 | Phase 9 | `refactor plan/build-slices/008-channel-cutover.md` | Move agent delivery, workflow review, and external webhook delivery from Channel to mailbox. Keep fallback until verification passes. |
| 009 | Phase 10 | `refactor plan/build-slices/009-runtime-host-transient-worktrees.md` | Split runtime host, transient sessions, and worktree/path-guard seams behind compatibility facade, tests. |
| 010 | Phase 11 | `refactor plan/build-slices/010-mcp-typed-client-capabilities.md` | MCP typed localhost client, capability registry, migrate tool families after their service contracts exist, tests. |
| 011 | Phase 12 | `refactor plan/build-slices/011-compatibility-cleanup.md` | Remove obsolete event shapes, compatibility routes, old Channel target paths, and duplicated local types after static-search gates pass. |

## Failure Path

If a session fails its advance gate:

1. Do not start the next numbered session.
2. Update `refactor plan/refactor-tracker.md` with the blocker.
3. Update `refactor plan/refactor-session-tracker.md` by adding a fix session immediately after the failed session.
4. The fix session prompt must name the failing slice and failing verification command.
5. Commit any docs or safe fixes that were completed.
6. End with a clean repo.

## Session 10 Gate

Session 10 is not complete until all of these pass:

- Slice 001 focused automated tests still pass.
- Full repo typecheck still passes.
- Two-client browser verification passes for project create visibility.
- Two-client browser verification passes for project metadata rename and restore.
- Two-client browser verification passes for project archive/delete visibility.
- Test-created project files are cleaned up or intentionally archived with the row left hidden.
- Trackers record the result.
- Repo is clean.

## Slice 002 Required Shape

Slice 002 must be the next planned slice. It is not optional and should not be swapped for mailbox, workflows, agents, or chat.

Required scope:

- `packages/contracts` live-event envelope for `project.changed`.
- `packages/db` additive `live_outbox` migration and repo.
- `packages/app-services` or server-owned live publisher boundary for project mutations.
- Server replay route for live events after cursor.
- Current websocket compatibility emission for existing clients.
- Web hook/client cursor/refetch behavior for project list/project metadata.
- Tests for scope filtering, cursor replay, transaction rollback, and two-client behavior.

Out of scope:

- Runtime transcript events.
- Mailbox events.
- Work-item events.
- Workflow events.
- Agent events.
- Channel removal.
- Deep `ProjectRuntime` changes.
